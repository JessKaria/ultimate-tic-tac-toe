## Ultimate-tic-tac-toe | Hot Sauce Editions

 

## Overview

This was my first project at General Assembly immersive course at GA London. We were tasked with creating a grid-based game to be rendered in the browser, and deployed online. We were given seven days to complete the project and were expected to build the project on our own.

Being my first time making anything, I opted for Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe, but recreated the game with my own spicy twist.

You can play the game on GitHub pages [here](https://jesskaria.github.io/ultimate-tic-tac-toe//), or find the GitHub repo [here](https://github.com/JessKaria/ultimate-tic-tac-toe).

## Brief

- **Render a game in the browser**
- **The game should be playable for two players on the same computer, taking turns to make their moves**
- **Include separate HTML / CSS / JavaScript files**
- **The winner should be displayed when the game is over**
- **Stick with KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid) and DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles**
- **Deploy your game online, where the rest of the world can access it**
- **Use semantic markup for HTML and CSS (adhere to best practices)**
- **Build a game individually.**
- **Be creative.**

## Challenges

The first challenge is to make a standard Tic Tac Toe game with win condition. Once this has been achieved the larger game also needs to be implemented. A good use of Object Oriented Programming can be very helpful here.

## Approach

As this was my first time building anything, I spent a day or so planning and whiteboarding out my thoughts around how I want the game mechanics to work, I then broke the game down into smaller 'codeable' components and began writing pseudo code for each of the parts. The first challenge was to make the basic tic-tac-toe game, but I always had one eye on how I was going to go about creating the larger game.

### Board & Winning Arrays

const boardZeroArray = [
  [0, 1, 2],
  [9, 10, 11],
  [18, 19, 20],
  [0, 9, 18],
  [1, 10, 19],
  [2, 11, 20],
  [0, 10, 20],
  [2, 10, 18]
]

I used flexbox to create my grid, and therefore hardcoded the winning combinations for each of the boards and stored them in an array.
